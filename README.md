# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This Project is an analysis for Louise to determine what dates her play should run and compares which performance type will be most successful

Based on the analysis conducted, plays have the highest success in comparison to all other types of entertainment. With plays having been the most done, there is a higher number of fails and successes; however, the percentage of success to fails far better outweighs all other options for Louise.

With this finding, it is also important to note that according to the data present. The best time frame to run a play would be from April thru August as all other plays that ran in this time frame saw the greatest success rate.

A noticable pattern to note is that failed plays had a higher goal, which some were unobtainable, that hindered the play from being close to reaching success. 

As a recommendation, I would suggest starting a play that begins in may and runs till August at the latest. A summer show. And set realistic goals for reasonable pledges. It would also be prudent to run the play in Great Britian. The data shows that Great Britian plays have a 75% success rate and a 22% fail rate. While the US has a lower success rate of 61% and higher failed rate of 37%. This information was found under the Subcategory tab in the Kickstarter where we can see success and failed rates according to each country. It is important to note the variable of season when doing the analysis. However, there is a higher chance for success in Great Britian with a summer show than any other place or time.
