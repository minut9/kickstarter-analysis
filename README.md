# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This Project is an analysis for Louise to determine what time of year her play should run and compares which performance type will be most successful. The kickstarter workbook is an analysis of data provided for plays in Ireland, Great Britian,and the United States. The data also depicts if the plays were successful or failures and how they fared on goal money raised, pledges, and what specific type of entertainment genre they chose, as well as what time of year the program ran.

This chart is the summary comparison of successful plays to failed plays. It is clear there are more successful plays than failed.

Based on the analysis conducted, plays have the highest success in comparison to all other types of entertainment, especially in the theatre category. With plays having been the most completed, there is a higher number of fails and success data available in this workbook; however, the percentage of success to fails far better outweighs all other options for Louise.

With this finding, it is also important to note that according to the data present. The best time frame to run a play would be from April thru August as all other plays that ran in this time frame saw the greatest success rate.

Another noticable pattern to note is that failed plays had a higher goal, which some were unobtainable, that hindered the play from being close to reaching success. While it is important to address the goals and pledges made for the plays. Setting a reasonable goal of money to raise for any show is ensuring the play will be successful within the boundaries set. The most successful plays set goals in the lower dollar amount margins, than compared to the higher amounts. 

The Outcomes Based on Goals sheet shows how "less is more". Majority of plays that had less than 10000 as a goal were successful, which also seemed to be more practical.
This data set shows how the lower the goal amount is to be raised, the more chance it has of bein sucessful. The 1000-4999 category had the highest amount of plays that were successful. This data set also shows how none of these plays were canceled, which is interesting due to the fact that all the plays in this field ran their dates of performance, some were not successful but most were. 


#Challenges

  The challenges of this kickstarter is to realize what the social norms are for each country. Think about a play that americans enjoy more than English do? A movie? TV show? Music? Comedy? References? Certain subjects and particular norms very from country to country based on usual social norms for each place. It is hard to compare much to the United States as Ireland and Great Britian are across the pond. The difference in societies would be a variable in this analysis. 

  Another challenge of this kickstarter would be the outliers. Performances that have not done their research before putting their program together, which in term     would set the program up for failure especially around certain times of the year and setting unrealistic goals of money to be raised, when it is simply             impossible to be done in this space. These programs would be considered outliers as they are blindly putting a program together with no past data or research done   that would ensure the program would be forced to fail. 
  
  For this workbook to go further into detail to solidify a sure answer for Louise, subjects of plays in each country would enhance the findings to see a pattern 
  with successes and failures.


As a recommendation, I would suggest starting a play that begins in may and runs till August at the latest. A summer show. And set realistic goals for reasonable pledges. Somewhere in the 1000-4999 range. It would also be prudent to run the play in Great Britian. The data shows that Great Britian plays have a 75% success rate and a 22% fail rate. While the US has a lower success rate of 61% and higher failed rate of 37%. This information was found under the Subcategory tab in the Kickstarter where we can see success and failed rates according to each country. It is important to note the variable of season when doing the analysis. However, there is a higher chance for success in Great Britian with a summer show than any other place or time.
